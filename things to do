1. **** IMPORTANT FOR GENERALIZATION ****
    We need a script that takes as input a video (in the format you like) and a path and:
        - creates the destination folder at the given path;
        - decomposes the video into frames;
        - resizes each frame to 200x200x3;
        - saves each frame as .jpg separately in the destination folder.
    We need this to fastly produce new train/test samples.

2.  **** IMPORTANT FOR GENERALIZATION ****
    Data Augmentation module that can work in two ways:
    2.1.
        ONLINE
            Given an image (numpy array 200x200x3) object and a number n, produces and returns n augmented images
            starting from the given one (color filters, shifting, etc. ). The produced images are returned in a new
            numpy array nx200x200x3
    2.2.
        OFFLINE
            Given an image (numpy array 200x200x3) object, a path and a number n, produces n augmented images
            starting from the given one and saves sequentially in the given destination folder. Having a customizable4
            name convention would be nice.
